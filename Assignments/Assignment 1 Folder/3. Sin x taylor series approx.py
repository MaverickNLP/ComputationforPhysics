# Question 4:
# As n increases the approximaiton of sin(x) becomes applicable to a wider range of values. At 10 values however, the difference between the
# approximation and 'real' values suggested by the math module becomes almost zero, with a magnitude of 10e-14. If you graph upto some crazy 
# number like 10000, a roughly linear pattern emerges, with a best fit line of approximately y = 4*10e-17*|x|. Which also implies an error of 0.
# This error is interesting, since I'm not sure what kind of algorithm Python's math module uses to calculate sine. But this problem seems to 
# suggest that it does not use a taylor series. Perhaps there's a more computationally efficient method of solving for the sin of some number.
# 
# Question 5:
# As n increases our approximation error also increases. But this is also limited since we're for any absolute values of theta that are greater than 
# 2pi we reference to values between 0 and pi using line 9 of the code. On second thought the implication here is that Python's math module's
# values are getting further away from the values that taylor_sin(x, n) returns. 

# There are also some spikes here and there which are perhaps somewhat interesting.
