# Computation for Physics

Coursework from the Computation for Physics course at Azim Premji University in Bangalore, India. 

The highlight of the coursework is the [project](https://github.com/kapa2006/ComputationforPhysics/tree/main/Project), questions are parts of the project that were formally required as part of our assessment criteria. Whereas extensions are parts of the project that I pursued out of my own interest. 

Download the repository and go through the code, and output gifs. This code was written for Python 3.12.4 and requires the installation of some packages particulary; numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.
