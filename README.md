# Computation for Physics

Coursework from the computation for physics course at Azim Premji University in Bangalore, India. 

The highlight of the coursework is the [project](https://github.com/kapa2006/ComputationforPhysics/tree/main/Project), I worked on the code for the 4th question, and pursued the extensions out of my own interest.
