# Computation for Physics

Coursework from the Computation for Physics course at Azim Premji University in Bangalore, India. 

The highlight of the coursework is the [project](https://github.com/kapa2006/ComputationforPhysics/tree/main/Project), questions are parts of the project that were formally required as part of our assessment criteria. Whereas extensions are parts of the project that I pursued out of my own interest.
