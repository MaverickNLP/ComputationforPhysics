#s1 = "123"
#print(int(s1)*2)
# we can multiply a var that has been converted from a string into an integer

#s2 = "abc"
#print(int(s2))
# 

#f = 3.99 
#print(int(f))
#prints the digits to the left of the decimal point. 

# i = 0 
# print(bool(i))
# prints false if 0, prints true if any other number

# s3 = "3.14abc"
# print(float(s3))
# it cannot convert abc to a number.

# A non numeric string cannot be converted to an integer or float since letters cannot be equal to some numbers. 
# False, since true adopts all values except 0, which is reserved for the bool false.
